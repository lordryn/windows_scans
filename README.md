# windows_scans
Common command scans in Python with tkinter.
This program runs a few scans I commonly run when testing internets.
-ping runs ping on the dress in the input field
-ip gets the machine's local IP
-public ip uses external sources to get the public IP of the machine. The second one is your IP.
-trace runs tracert on the address in the input field
